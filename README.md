This cheeky lil boi counts the number of times our teacher says the statement "So the reality is"
- You can add another reality by typing into discord "?reality", and an extra reality will be added to the reality count
- You can call back on how many realities there are with "?mh count", and the current number of realities will be displayed
- The dates that an extra reality the was created can be called back upon on when with "?date + [date you want to find]", and the number of realities that were added on that day will be added.

The file counter.txt holds the value for the reality count so that it is not lost each time to program stops running.
The file date.txt holds that data that eah reality was created.
